## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Recommended)

This delivers a fully functional video highlight pipeline that:
- Processes multiple MP4 videos
- Extracts interesting segments (quality threshold 7/10)
- Ranks segments using quality formula (60% scene, 25% motion, 15% composition)
- Assembles chronological highlight reel
- Outputs final MP4 video

**Estimated Tasks for MVP**: T001-T068 (68 tasks)

### Incremental Delivery

After MVP, add features incrementally in priority order:
1. **US2 (P2)**: Manual override capability → T069-T081 (13 tasks)
2. **US3 (P3)**: Enhanced composition → T082-T106 (25 tasks)
3. **US4 (P4)**: Audio enhancement → T107-T122 (16 tasks)
4. **US5 (P5)**: Incremental execution → T123-T133 (11 tasks)
5. **Polish**: Production readiness → T134-T155 (22 tasks)

**Total Tasks**: 155

## Notes

**Test Strategy**: Tests are optional and not included in main task flow unless explicitly requested. Integration tests (T062-T068, T078-T081, T101-T106, T118-T122, T130-T133) validate user story acceptance criteria.

**Parallel Execution**: Tasks marked [P] can be executed in parallel with other [P] tasks in the same group. Tasks without [P] have dependencies on earlier tasks.

**File Paths**: All file paths are absolute from repository root. Ensure correct directory structure per plan.md before executing tasks.

**Checkpoint Strategy**: Each phase produces a checkpoint. Manual edits to checkpoints enable user story 2 (P2) functionality.

**Quality Formula**: 60% scene changes + 25% motion + 15% composition with minimum threshold 7/10 per specification clarifications.
