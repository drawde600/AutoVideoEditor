## Next Steps

**OPTION 1 - Start Implementation with Current State (Recommended)**
- 78/140 items (56%) complete - sufficient for MVP
- All critical architecture and quality scoring items resolved
- Remaining items mostly edge cases and detailed formatting
- Can address gaps during implementation as needed

**OPTION 2 - Address High Priority Gaps First**
- Focus on 10-15 high priority items (CHK012-014, CHK023-024, etc.)
- Should take 30-60 minutes
- Then proceed to implementation

**Which approach would you prefer?**
